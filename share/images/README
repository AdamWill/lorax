This directory contains image files that can be used to create media
capable of starting the @PRODUCT@ installation process.

The boot.iso file is an ISO 9660 image of a bootable CD-ROM. It is useful
in cases where the CD-ROM installation method is not desired, but the
CD-ROM's boot speed would be an advantage.

To use this image file, burn the file onto CD-R (or CD-RW) media as you
normally would.
