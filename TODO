- Finish rewriting the code in rewrite/
- Have pylorax extend YumBase rather than invoking yum independently, we want
  to be able to take in a YumBase object from other things, such as pungi
- Write a man page for lorax
- Hook lorax up to pungi (provide Jesse with a patch)
- Support a verbose output mode (and disabling it)
- Make sure we are root when executed
- If we have to be root, should lorax be in /usr/sbin ?
- Use OptionParser instead of getopt (?)
- Create a Lorax class that can be used directly by pungi
- Move conf hash table to something more object-like
- Merge treeinfo and discinfo stuff in to InstRoot class
